# Biography:

I am a postdoc at [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.amss.cas.cn) (from 2018-2020). My mentors are [Prof. Haibao Duan](http://www.math.ac.cn/kyry/201501/t20150116_276433.html), [Prof. Fei Han (NUS)](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mathanf/), and [Prof. Jianzhong Pan](http://www.math.ac.cn/kyry/201501/t20150116_276445.html).

I got my PhD degree at [Department of Mathematics of National University of Singapore](http://ww1.math.nus.edu.sg) at Nov. 2017, under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Wu](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~matwujie/). 

From 2011 to 2014, I was working with [Prof. Xiugui Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiugui_Liu) in [Nankai University](http://en.sms.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm) as a master student. 

Before that, I got the diploma of material physics at [Dalian University of Technology](http://mse.dlut.edu.cn/English.htm), and thereafter worked in two electric companies as technologist and designer for two years.

# Research Interests:

Algebraic topology and applications related to manifold topology, differential geometry and mathematical physics, etc.
