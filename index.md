# Biography:

I am a postdoc at [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.amss.cas.cn) (from 2018-2020). My mentors are [Prof. Haibao Duan](http://www.math.ac.cn/kyry/201501/t20150116_276433.html), [Prof. Fei Han (NUS)](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mathanf/), and [Prof. Jianzhong Pan](http://www.math.ac.cn/kyry/201501/t20150116_276445.html).

I got my PhD degree at [Department of Mathematics of National University of Singapore](http://ww1.math.nus.edu.sg) at Nov. 2017, under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Wu](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~matwujie/). 

From 2011 to 2014, I was working with [Prof. Xiugui Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiugui_Liu) in [Nankai University](http://en.sms.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm) as a master student. 

Before that, I got the diploma of material physics at [Dalian University of Technology](http://mse.dlut.edu.cn/English.htm), and thereafter worked in two electric companies as technologist and designer for two years.

## Unstable homotopy theory:

- (with Jie Wu), Exponential growth of homotopy groups of suspended finite complexes, 21 pages, to appear in _Mathematische Zeitschrift_. arXiv:1706.02918                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the homotopy groups of simply connected finite $p$-local complexes, and define a space to be locally hyperbolic if its homotopy groups have exponential growth. Under some certain conditions related to the functorial decomposition of loop suspension, we prove that the suspended finite complexes are locally hyperbolic if suitable but accessible information of the homotopy groups is known. In particular, we prove that Moore spaces are locally hyperbolic, and other candidates are also given.

- (with Jie Wu), Combinatorics of double loop suspensions, evaluation maps and Cohen groups, 37 pages, to appear in _Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan_. arXiv:1706.02916                                                                                                                                                                         

Abstract: We reformulate Milgram's model of double loop suspension in terms of a preoperad of posets, each stage of which is the poset of all ordered partitions of a finite set. Using this model, we give a combinatorial model for the evaluation map and use it to study Cohen representation for the group of homotopy classes of maps between double loop suspensions. In particular, we recover Wu's shuffle relations and further provide a type of secondary relations in the Cohen groups using the classic Toda bracket.

Abstract: We first show that simply connected co-$H$-spaces and connected $H$-spaces can be uniquely decomposed into prime factors in the category of pointed $p$-local spaces of finite type, which may be used to develop a $p$-local version of Gray's correspondence between homotopy types of prime co-$H$-spaces and homotopy types of prime $H$-spaces, and the split fibration which connects them as well. Further, we use the unique decomposition theorem to study the homotopy rigidity problem for classic functors. Among others, we prove that $\Sigma \Omega$ and $\Omega$ are homotopy rigid on simply connected $p$-local co-$H$-spaces of finite type, and $\Omega\Sigma $ and $\Sigma$ are homotopy rigid on connected $p$-local $H$-spaces of finite type.

Abstract: We prove a necessary condition for the existence of the $A_p$-structure on ${\rm mod}~p$ spaces, and also derive a simple proof for the finiteness of the number of ${\rm mod}~p$ $A_p$-spaces of given rank. As a direct application, we compute a list of possible types of rank $3$ ${\rm mod}~3$ homotopy associative $H$-spaces.


## Applications of homotopy theory related to geometry and mathematical physics:    

- (with Haibao Duan and Fei Han), String^c structures and modular invariants, 40 pages, arXiv:1905.02093

Abstract: In this paper, we study some algebraic topology aspects of String$^c$ structures, more precisely, from the aspect of Whitehead tower and the aspect of the loop group of $Spin^c(n)$. We also extend the generalized Witten genus constructed for the first time in \cite{CHZ11} to String$^c$ structures of various levels and apply them to study actions of compact non-abelian simply connected Lie groups.

- Homotopy types of gauge groups over high dimensional manifolds, 32 pages, submitted. arXiv:1805.04879

Abstract: The homotopy theory of gauge groups received considerable attentions in the recent decades, in the theme of which, the works mainly focus on bundles over $4$-dimensional manifolds and vary the structure groups case by case. In this work, we study the homotopy theory of gauge groups over higher dimensional manifolds with mild restrictions on the structure groups of principal bundles. In particular, we study gauge groups of bundles over $(n-1)$-connected closed $2n$-manifolds, the classification of which was determined by Wall and Freedman. We also investigate the gauge groups of the total spaces of sphere bundles based on the classical work of James and Whitehead. Furthermore, other types of $2n$-manifolds are also considered. In all the cases, we show various homotopy decompositions of gauge groups. The methods are of combinations of manifold topology and various techniques in homotopy theory, and are quite general and applicable to other types of manifolds as well.

- (with Xiugui Liu), The rational homotopical nilpotency of principal $U_n(\mathbb{C})$-bundles, _Topology and its Applications_ 160 (2013), 1466-1475. PDF

Abstract: Let $Aut(p)$ denote the space of all self-fibre-homotopy equivalences of a given principal $U_n(\mathbb{C})$-bundle of simply connected CW complexes with total space finite. We prove an explicit and sharp inequality for the rational nilpotency of the component of $Aut(p)$ containing identity, where the generalized characteristic classes are involved. The results are proved based on the general results of Y. Félix, G. Lupton and S.B. Smith concerning the rational homotopy of $Aut(p)$, and also of Salvatore discussing the rational nilpotency of $Aut(X)$.
